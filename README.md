# Scientific Computing with Python
## freeCodeCamp.org

>The Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) curriculum will equip you with the skills to analyze and manipulate data using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. You'll learn key concepts like data structures, algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and how to perform complex calculations using a variety of tools.

>This comprehensive course will guide you through the fundamentals of scientific computing, including data structures, and algorithms.

Here I collect all the tutorials and projects I did for [this freeCodeCamp-Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) to earn my Certificate.
